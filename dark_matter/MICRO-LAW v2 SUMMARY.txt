PHYSICS INTERPRETATION
============================================================

Bit 6: 80.1%
  Gas bits used: None
  Disk bits used: [3, 6, 7]
  Radius bits used: [3, 5, 7]
  → Dark matter couples primarily to STARS

Bit 5: 71.0%
  Gas bits used: None
  Disk bits used: None
  Radius bits used: [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7]

Bit 4: 70.0%
  Gas bits used: [6]
  Disk bits used: [6, 7]
  Radius bits used: [0, 2, 5, 6]
  → Dark matter couples to BOTH gas and stars differently!
